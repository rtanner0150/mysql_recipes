# mysql_recipes
 
* This lab is going to be relatively simple, since this is all new. We’re going to pull down the script to build the Recipe Database and build schema in the left side of http://sqlfiddle.com/. 
* After the database is created, do the following: 
    * Comment the code and clearly explain what the script is doing when you get it. Also comment and document everything you add. 
    * Insert 5 new recipes and their ingredients, amounts, and measures into the Database.
    * Write a query to get a list of all the Recipes from the Database.
    * And write a query to get all the Recipes that use a certain ingredient. 
    * Write a query to update a recipe you added.
* Run your script so you can see your collections built and the operations run on it. 
* Take some time to poke around outside of your script with the database! 
* Then push your new script back to GitHub.
